\title{Estimate sample probability for each SNP from gene density}
\usage{
snpProb(gene.pos, snp.pos, bw = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene.pos}{a matrix of two columns. The first column contains the 
chromosome, the second column contains the position of a gene (e.g. start in bp).}

\item{snp.pos}{a matrix of two rcolumns. The first column contains the 
chromosome, the second column contains the position of a SNP in bp.}

\item{bw}{see \code{\link[stats]{density}}.}
}
